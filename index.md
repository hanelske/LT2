# Ground-breaking rapid robotic follow-up with a 4-metre successor to the Liverpool Telescope

Welcome to the new webpage for the Liverpool New Robotic Telescope; a collaboration between Liverpool John Moores University and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. The [design team](team.md), established in early 2018, are in the process of finalising the engineering and science requirements of the facility.

The [news](news.md) page details the latest project developments including workshops, meetings, partners and outreach.

As part of the Astrophysics Research Institute at LJMU, we are dedicated to pushing our [equity and diversity](ed.md) initiatives and creating a welcoming working environment and partnership.
