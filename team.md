# Meet the Team

The NRT design team consist of staff from LJMU and IAC. Below is a brief bio and photo of each of the team members.

Chris Copperwheat; NRT Deputy-PI.

I am the Liverpool Telescope Astronomer in Charge and a Reader in Time Domain Astrophysics in the Astrophysics Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University. I obtained my PhD in 2007 from University College London, and then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick before joining LJMU in 2012. My research interests span a wide array of time variable phenomena, including (but not limited to) white dwarf binaries, exoplanets and gravitational wave counterparts.
