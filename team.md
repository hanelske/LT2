I am the Liverpool Telescope Astronomer in Charge and a Reader in Time Domain Astrophysics in the Astrophysics Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University. I obtained my PhD in 2007 from University College London, and then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick before joining LJMU in 2012. My research interests span a wide array of time variable phenomena, including (but not limited to) white dwarf binaries, exoplanets and gravitational wave counterparts.

I obtained my PhD from LJMU in 2016 and worked as an E-ELT PDRA at Lancaster and an Instrument Scientist for the MOPTOP polarimeter project at LJMU before joining the NRT project in Spring 2018. My research interests are optical polarimetry, particularly of blazars, and instrumentation. I am one of the co-chairs of the ARI's Equality and Diversity team and I am also the Diversity and Wellbeing representative for the departmental Management Board. In my spare time I like to practice yoga, play rugby and go to music gigs.

I finished my PhD entitled the 'Structure and Evolution of Classical Nova Shells' in January 2018 at NUI Galway. I now work as the Instrument Scientist for the Liverpool New Robotic Telescope to be built on the Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma). Aside from developing the instrumentation for the New Robotic Telscope, my research interests revolve around the nebulae created from stellar destruction events in binary systems. Outside of work you may find me swimming in the ocean or surfing the sidewalks.
