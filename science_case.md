# Science Case

Building on the success of the fully autonomous and robotic Liverpool Telescope, the design of its 4 metre successor is underway. The focus is on fast follow-up of rapidly varying and fading transients, including gravitational wave candidates and new and exciting object which are anticipated to be discovered in the new upcoming era of survey telescopes. The next decade will see the commissioning of many major international projects, opening new windows on the time-variable universe. They will make it possible to search wider areas of the sky than ever before, and as such discover new classes of transient and time-variable sources at optical, radio and high-energy Gamma-ray wavelengths and using multimessenger and particle physics. There is a critical need for a new 4.0m optical follow-up facility to rapidly respond to such discoveries and make detailed photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric observations.

The key science drivers are supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, exoplanets, Gaia sources, fast-radio bursts, and new and currently unknown sources that will be discovered. In particular the NRT will carry out 
i) ultra-rapid (<30 seconds) spectroscopic and polarimetric follow-up of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave (aLIGO/Virgo) and neutrino (IceCUBE/ANTARES) sources and new radio (e.g. LOFAR/SUPERB) and high energy (e.g. SVOM, Fermi, Einstein Probe) transients, 
ii) rapid (<1hr) spectroscopy and polarimetry of (e.g. LSST/ZTF) supernovae (SNe) to explore the shock-breakout phase and find spectral signatures of the progenitor, and of recurrent novae (the supposed progenitors of Type Ia SNe, 
iii) timely (<24 hours) and time resolved spectroscopy of the evolution of the previously mentioned sources, plus galactic transients such as outbursting binary X-ray transients and eruptive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) detected by VISTA/Pan-STARRS/LSST, and iv) simultaneous spectroscopic and polarimetric montioring of sources such as blazars (e.g. with Fermi, CTA) and changing-look AGN.

The primary first-light instrument will be a spectrograph, driven by the large amount of transient classification which requires spectroscopy, and the other instrumentation to follow will consist of photometric and polarimetric capabilities. 

The success of the Liverpool Telescope is partly due to the flexibility of instrumentation to suit the user. While the NRT will have fewer (i.e. no more than 5) instruments than the LT, we are open to user feedback and ideas for the new instrumentation suite.
