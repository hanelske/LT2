# Science Case

Building on the success of the fully autonomous and robotic Liverpool Telescope, the design of its 4 metre successor is underway. The focus is on fast follow-up of rapidly varying and fading transients, including gravitational wave candidates and new and exciting object which are anticipated to be discovered in the new upcoming era of survey telescopes.

The key science drivers are supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, exoplanets, Gaia sources, fast-radio bursts, and new and currently unknown sources that will be discovered by survey telescopes such as the LSST.

The primary first-light instrument will be a spectrograph, driven by the large amount of transient classification which requires spectroscopy, and the other instrumentation to follow will consist of photometric and polarimetric capabilities. 

The success of the Liverpool Telescope is partly due to the flexibility of instrumentation to suit the user. While the NRT will have fewer (i.e. no more than 5) instruments than the LT, we are open to user feedback and ideas for the new instrumentation suite.
